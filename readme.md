# Living Stories

A concept created at [NZZ Virtual Reality Hackdays 2015](hackdays.nzz.ch/vr15/). The basic idea is to visualize facts behind news stories as an immersive experience. E.g. showing distances, heights and volumes.

This repository contains an example storyline, an early prototype made in Unity and the final presentation.
